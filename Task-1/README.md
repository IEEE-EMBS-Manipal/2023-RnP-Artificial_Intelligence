## Programming [Python]

It is recommended to use Python since it's the most widely used and has excellent support in building and training models with its libraries and frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, etc.

- Accessing and Installations
  - If you're using locally, Install Anaconda
    - https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads
      - Available for Windows, macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon), and Linux
    - Install Python, Jupyter Notebook, and other libraries by default.
    - Jupyter Notebooks (https://jupyter.org/)
  - Google Colab
    - https://colab.google/notebooks/
    - https://colab.research.google.com/#create=true
    - Log in using your Google account, and save your Notebooks on Google Drive
  - Kaggle
    - https://www.kaggle.com/

- Explore the *TensorFlow Keras Framework*

  - https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras
  - https://keras.io/getting_started/
  - https://keras.io/getting_started/learning_resources/

### TASK-1b

Build an MNIST Digit Classifier.

Upload the Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb`, and the PDF file in the Teams Folder, and an arrangement will be made later to upload to this GitHub Repository. Use the filename format: `AI-Task-1-[First name]`.

(Feel free to use any other format if you prefer: `.py` file, .`ipynb` file, Colab Notebook, Kaggle notebook, etc.).

Model solutions for suitable problems will be available after the due date of the task completion, or an appropriate solution resource will be shared. Check it out at https://github.com/IEEE-EMBS-Manipal/2023-RnP-Artificial_Intelligence when it's available there.
